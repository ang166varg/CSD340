        <p class="intro">
            I grew up in South Los Angeles, where I spent majoirty of my childhood and then around 3 years ago I just recently moved to Colorado. 
            <span class="sentence">My favorite memories involve spending a lot of time with my family and being able to go to the beach often.</span> 
            My family has came over recently to visit every now and then where we go hiking and enjoy the Colorado experience. 
        </p>

        <p>
            During my childhood, I developed a love for reading and storytelling. I would spend hours curled up with books, imagining new worlds and characters. 
            Over time, I also grew interested in technology, and I began experimenting with computers and simple coding projects. 
            This interest eventually led me to pursue my studies in software development.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy painting, baking, and photography. I find that creative activities help me relax and give me a fresh perspective on my work. 
            Whether it’s capturing the perfect sunset photo or baking bread from scratch, I love creating things that bring joy to others. 
            My hobbies also give me new ideas and inspiration for projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Family is very important to me, and I am lucky to have a close and supportive one. We make an effort to spend quality time together, whether it’s sharing visiting in the holidays or calling for hours. 
            Their encouragement motivates me to work hard and pursue my goals. 
            I’m grateful for the values and lessons they have taught me.
        </p>
